                     # SDLC LIFE CYCLE:
                     
# SDLC -  software development life cycle - process of development of application 
          with good quality and delevired at right time:
# Timeline -  blueprint , application deatiles , programming lang , production , user interface,cost. etc.,
# why is SDLC 
  # layout for your entier project
         # planning
         # scheduling
         # budgeting
         # risk management
         # timeline
  # proper understanding about application or project planning
  # estimated time that is required to build the application
  # what framework , data-base, programming language is required
  # set goal of deliverable, document, (trackes the data --------> microsoft project, conbun boar----->trello
  # client and developer relationship
# 50% of amount is need to start the project (paied before)

                      SDLC PHASES: 
                      
# 1. analysis                    ------> analyse the entire process
# 2. defining the project        ------>
# 3. design the project          ------>
# 4. project execution           ------> mile-stone
# 5. soft-ware testing           ------>
# 6. deployment                  ------>
# 7. project closure             ------>

# 1. analysis phase:
     # you create a project plan with the clients detailes.
     # discussion
     # a project deal/ chater b/w client and company is sealed
     # requirements are being deait with the team intemal discussions begin to happen.

# 2. defining phase:
     # set goals
     # set the time-line
     # set the cost
     # analyze the risks
     # SRS -------------> software requirement specification document.
 
 # 3. designing  phase:
     # UI/UX of the application
     # what will be the software architecture to be used
     # DDS --------------> document design specification document
     # DDS - being ready by all the stacke-holders
  
  # 4. project execution phase:
     # software will be developed based on SRS and DDS document
  
  # 5. testing phase:
     # STLC is going to happen
     # testing of the software is being done by the testers for bugs.
  
  # 6. deployment phase:
     # deploy the application to the physical server/cloud
     # give training to the client regarding the application
     
  # 7. project closure phase:
     # full document to the client
     # company receives the pending amount from the client
     # a company party is being thrown for the successful implementation and completion of the project

# SDLC-------> software testing life-cycle

stlc is a process of sequence done to achieve a testing process so that we can deliver software of good quality

it validates and verifies the process of st

# STLC phases:

         # 1. analysis
         # 2. planning
         # 3. test case development
         # 4. test environment setup
         # 5. exexution
         # 6. reporting
         # 7. closure
         
 # analysis phase:
     # case-study on the project done by the team
     # testing team looks for the requisites
     # ether automation testing is required or not
     # fessibility study report
     # TM document( requirement traceablity matrix)

#  test planning phases:
     # prepare a plan for the test
     # cost estimation
     # risk analysis
     # roles and responsibility
     
# test case development phase:
     # create test case datas
     # create test case scripts
 
# test evvironment set-up phase:
     # you make a software testing purpose
     # setup the test data
     # do some fake / smoke test on the application
     
# test execution phase:
     # tester tests the application based on test scripts and test datas
     # if there is any bugs it will be reported to the development team
     # the development team will receive the bug and send it again to the testing team
     # the testing team will test the module with same scenario for any furthe bugs
     # if there is no bugs then it will be send for public sector
  
 # reporting phase:
     # report send to the project management team
     
 # project closure phase:
     # complete documentation of the project is being done
     # qualitative and quantative analysis is being done on it.
